		<p>Freeze-thaw cycle isn't awful, but does make this trail rather slick. Lost Lake starts at its namesake trailhead. While it has no real technical features to speak of since being redesigned, it is a lot of fun to ride this glassy smooth and generally well-bermed trail.</p>

		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>This city has all the best bike shops.</p>
		<p>After a very quick downhill out of the gate, the route climbs up through big forest. You can find everyone out here having fun from people in body armor and downhill bikes to families testing their kids limits to xc racer types riding intervals.</p>
		<p>Small tree down between bottom of trail and bridge crossing. For the ultimate downhill blast, ride to the top of Hickory Mountain Loop, take a minute to catch your breath and prepare to smile all the way to the parking lot, barely needing to pedal.</p>

		<h2>Where to look</h2>
		<p><strong>Plane: </strong>The objectives of this project are to promote mountain biking by creating a progressive trail that can be enjoyed by riders of all ages and ability level, and to increase the diversity of riding opportunities.</p>
		<p><strong>More Stuff: </strong>ut here you will find the most legal features including log rides, jumps and rock rolls in South Tahoe including the new jumps, berms, rollers and hips TAMBA and SBTS built in 2014..</p>
		<p><strong>Bike: </strong>Trail can be ridden in either direction. There is an optional drop 1/2 way down. Two wheel drifting is likely if you have speed but are not riding the top few inches of the berms. Very loose and dry.</p>
